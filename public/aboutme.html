<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Yuvraj, a passionate and self-taught web developer with a creative flair for crafting beautiful, functional, and user-friendly websites. With a foundation in digital marketing and content creation, I bring a unique blend of technical skills and marketing insight to every project I work on.</p>

<p>I started my journey in website development on Wix Studio, where I learned the basics of design and functionality. Driven by my curiosity and a desire to build more complex and custom solutions, I decided to deepen my skills in web development. Currently, I am enrolled in "The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp" by Dr. Angela Yu, aiming to complete it within 100 days, all while balancing my studies as a pharmacy student.</p>

<p>My approach to web development is guided by a commitment to simplicity, elegance, and functionality. I enjoy working on projects that challenge me to think outside the box, from designing seamless user experiences to developing robust, responsive websites.</p>

<p>Beyond web development, I have a keen interest in technology, including automation, IoT, robotics, and AI/ML. I’m also exploring various business ventures, such as my digital marketing agency, and a new idea to combine e-commerce and SaaS solutions. When I’m not coding, you might find me tinkering with electronics, listening to my favorite music, or brainstorming ideas for my next big project.</p>

<p>I believe in continuous learning and innovation, and I’m excited to collaborate on projects that make a difference. If you’re looking for a developer who brings creativity, dedication, and a diverse skill set to the table, let's connect!</p>
